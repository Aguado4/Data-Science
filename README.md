## Introduction

This repository showcases three main activities aimed at applying statistical methods and data science techniques to real-world problems. The projects utilize R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Activity 1: Real Estate Market Report

### Overview

In this activity, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the real estate market in Cali, Colombia. The analysis was based on data collected by the B&C real estate agency, which included information on property prices, locations, features, and sales.

### Key Learnings

- **Data Analysis:** Learned to preprocess and clean real estate data.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Gained insights into the distribution and trends of property prices in different areas.
- **Data Visualization:** Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.

### Report Highlights

- **Introduction:** Background and objectives of the analysis.
- **Methods:** Statistical techniques and tools used.
- **Results:** Key findings and trends.
- **Discussion:** Interpretation of results and implications for the business.
- **Conclusions:** Summary of insights and recommendations.

## Activity 2: Statistical Simulations

### Overview

This activity involved performing various statistical simulations to understand and validate properties of estimators and statistical theorems.

### Key Learnings

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Used to estimate the value of π and understand the distribution of estimators.
- **Estimator Properties:** Analyzed bias, efficiency, and consistency of different estimators.
- **Central Limit Theorem:** Verified the theorem through simulations and observed its implications on sample distributions.

### Simulation Problems

1. **Estimation of π:** Simulated random points to approximate the value of π.
2. **Properties of Estimators:** Evaluated different estimators for a given parameter.
3. **Central Limit Theorem:** Simulated sampling distributions to demonstrate the theorem.
4. **Bootstrap Estimation:** Constructed confidence intervals using bootstrap methods.

## Activity 3: Linear Regression Analysis

### Overview

In this activity, I built multiple linear regression models to predict real estate prices based on the area of the property. The data was sourced from Fincaraiz for apartments in a specific price range and area.

### Key Learnings

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted thorough analysis to understand relationships between variables.
- **Linear Regression:** Built and interpreted multiple linear regression models.
- **Model Comparison:** Compared different models to find the best fit.
- **Model Validation:** Validated model assumptions and performed hypothesis testing.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Predicted property prices and evaluated the models' performance.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Exploratory Analysis:** Examined distributions and relationships between price and area.
2. **Model Estimation:** Estimated and interpreted several linear regression models.
3. **Confidence Intervals:** Constructed and interpreted intervals for model coefficients.
4. **Model Validation:** Checked assumptions and improved model fit.
5. **Model Comparison:** Compared the fit and assumptions of multiple models to select the best one.
6. **Predictive Analysis:** Predicted prices using the best-fitting model and assessed its accuracy.

### Report Highlights

- **Introduction:** Background and objectives of the analysis.
- **Methods:** Statistical techniques and tools used for model estimation.
- **Results:** Key findings from the models, including the best-fitting model.
- **Discussion:** Interpretation of results, including model comparison and validation.
- **Conclusions:** Summary of insights, model recommendations, and potential business implications.

## Conclusions

Through these activities, I have developed a deeper understanding of statistical analysis and data science techniques using R. Each project provided practical experience with real-world data, enhancing my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
